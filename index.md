Your first blog post

You may or may not have noticed, there’s already a blog post in there. Take a minute to look at it in the browser, maybe even view it on your phone to see how it looks.

Then go back to GitHub to view the files. Blog posts are stored in the _posts folder and you will see a file in there for the sample blog post.

Before we dive too deep into this, let’s lay out a some of the things you need to know about blogging with GitHub Pages:

    GitHub Pages uses software called “Jekyll” to handle all the fancy stuff behind the scenes. Jekyll is what converts your blog post files into nicely formatted HTML that you can view in the browser. Jekyll is capable of doing a TON of great stuff, but for now, that’s really all you need to know.

    Blog post files should always be named using this format: yyyy-mm-dd-your-blog-post-name.md

    A post written on January 28th, 2021, would be named 2021-01-28-my-blog-post.md. Be careful not to use future dates because the post won’t show up.

    Posts are written in markdown, if you don’t know it, don’t worry, there’s not much to it. See this post by GitHub to learn some of the basics.

That’s about all you need to know to get started.


Here you can say lots of fun things about your site.

Maybe say a some things about yourself.

Or maybe what you plan to blog about.
